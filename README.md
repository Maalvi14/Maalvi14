# Hi, I'm Manuel! :)

i'm a recent Computer Science Graduate working on AI Security / SRE.

I'm passionate about bridging AI Security and Site Reliability Engineering to ensure AI can advance without going **boom**.

Here's what I've been working on recently:

- Actively contributing to PyRIT, a cutting-edge AI Red Teaming tool.
- Starting work on Atomic Red Team Project
- Developing automated environments to test AI server infrastructure, including:
  - Apple's Private Cloud Computing (PCC)
  - Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP)

I thrive at the intersection of AI, security, and automation, constantly learning and applying new ideas to solve complex challenges.

 ðŸš€ **Fun Fact**: I'm looking for professionals to help in my Apple PCC and Anthropic's MCP projects!
