# Hi, I'm Manuel! :)

i'm a recent Computer Science Graduate working on AI Security / SRE.

I'm passionate about bridging AI Security and Site Reliability Engineering to ensure AI can advance without going **boom**.

Here's what I've been working on recently:

- Expanding GlucoSense to handle more complex prediction (e.g. Insulin efficiency)
- Simulating AI Clusters with RoCE communication using LimaVM + Soft-RoCE

I thrive at the intersection of AI, security, and automation, constantly learning and applying new ideas to solve complex challenges.
